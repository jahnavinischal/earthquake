## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used spans **30 years** of global earthquake data, sourced from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/the-ultimate-earthquake-dataset-from-1990-2023)) 

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** for data processing and modeling
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Pickle (.pkl)** files for model storage

## 🚀 Features

- Predict earthquake likelihood based on input parameters
- Load and use pre-trained models from `.pkl` files
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit
- Based on long-term historical seismic activity data

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jahnavinischal/earthquake-prediction.git
   cd earthquake-prediction

2. Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit web app:
   streamlit run index.py
   
If .pkl model files are not already present, they will be generated automatically on the first run.

#🧪 Usage
-Launch the app using the command above.
-Input the necessary parameters via the interface.
-View the predicted earthquake outcome and other related insights.


#📎 Notes
a. Make sure the dataset is placed in the correct directory if required.
b. The model might take a few moments to generate if .pkl files don’t exist.
